Oh I swear this town gets smaller everyday,
And I'm waiting for my chance.
I'm gonna break away.
I'm so sick and tired of being told what's good for me.
People got lots of ideas, of who I'm supposed to be.
[Chorus]
Angel carry me, oh so far away.
May my body never, touch the ground.
And If I promise you that I'll be back someday,
Will you set me free so I can fly away?
Fly away, fly away
Well most folks here well they don't dig too deep.
They can't dream too big
Cause they've got fields to keep
I could walk away and leave my family.
Or get buried alive in this legacy.
[Chorus]
I want to sleep under a different piece of sky
I want to live a little bit before I die
I want to be so close to heaven I see angels
[Chorus]
Fly away fly away
