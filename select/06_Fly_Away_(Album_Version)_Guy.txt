Yeah, there's comes a time in your life
You wanna get away from the stress and the drama
Baby mama, baby papas, bad dreams, [Incomprehensible]

Seems like I'm the only one who feels this way
Another rainy day on my parade
I can't take this pain no more, I'm out the door
I don't know where I'll go, but it's killing me so

I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away
I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away

I need to get away to find myself
I'm tired of all the stress, I need to be free, yeah
I've never once in my life been this down
Don't want nobody around and it's killing me, oh

I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away
I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away

You wanna be high, you wanna fly with Guy
You wanna get away, then fly with Day
You wanna be high, you wanna fly with Guy
You wanna get away, yeah then fly with Day

You wanna go high, you wanna fly with Guy
You wanna get away, then fly with Day
You wanna go high, you wanna fly with Guy
You wanna get away then fly with Day

I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away
I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away

I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away
I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away

I think I'm gonna get away
I think I'm gonna fly away, far away
